# React Docs Project ðŸ“‚

A front-end practice project I built to learn and implement React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. This app features an interactive, drag-and-drop card interface.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Draggable Cards:** Users can click and drag cards around the screen.
* **Hover Animations:** Cards scale up smoothly on hover.
* **Dynamic Tag:** The "Download Now" tag at the bottom is rendered conditionally.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

* **React:** Used for the core component structure.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used for all styling and the utility-first design.
* **Framer Motion:** Used to power all animations and drag-and-drop physics.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

This project was a great hands-on learning experience. I learned:
* How to build a complete application from small, reusable React components.
* How to implement complex gestures like dragging with Framer Motion.
* How to use Framer Motion's `dragConstraints` to keep elements inside a parent container.
* How to conditionally render elements (like the download tag) based on data.
